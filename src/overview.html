<p>
The purpose of the TransNook project is to make the Japanese-English
dictionary of the JMdict/EDICT project available in a MySQL database that
can be searched in a number of ways.
</p>
<h1>1. Format of JMdict/EDICT file</h1>
<p>
The format of the JMdict/EDICT file is - predictably - complex, but it is entirely rational.
The official statement of the file's format is found 
 <a href="http://www.edrdg.org/jmdictdb/cgi-bin/edhelp.py"><b>here</b></a>

</p>
<h3>A. JMdict/EDICT entities</h3>
<p>
For purposes of the CVCTW TransNook project, the important elements of the file's format are the four <u>entities</u>: entry, term, definition and meaning.
<ul>
<li>
Each line of the file represents one dictionary <b>entry</b>, defining a term or phrase.
<br>
Each parsed line becomes an instance of the cvctw.edict.EdictEntry class.
<br>
Each <b>entry</b> ends with a unique JMdict/EDICT entry identifier of the form "EntLnnnnn", where "nnnnn" are numeric digits.
</li>
<li>
Each entry may define more than one space-delimited Japanese <b>term</b> or phrase.
<br>
We may think of these alternative terms or phrases as synonyms.
<br>
Each alternative term or phrase becomes an instance of the cvctw.edict.EdictTerm class.

</li>
<li>
Each entry may contain more than one English <b>definition</b>, delimited by a number in parentheses, e.g., (3).
<br>
Each definition becomes an instance of the cvctw.edict.Definition class.

</li>
<li>
Each definition may contain more than one synonymous <b>meaning</b>, delimited by a slash ("/").
<br>
Each meaning becomes an instance of the cvctw.edict.EdictMeaning class.

</li>
</ul>


</p>
<p>
This hierarchy of entities may be represented graphically this way:
<pre>
	Entries 1..n
		Terms 1..n
		Definitions 1..n
			Meanings 1..n
</pre>
</p>
<p>
These parent-child <i>relationships</i> are represented in Java code thus:
<ul>
<li>
The cvctw.edict.Edict<b>Entry</b> class has 
<ul>
<li>a list (ArrayList) of cvctw.edict.Edict<b>Term</b> classes and</li>
<li>a list of cvctw.edict.Edict<b>Definition</b> classes.</li>
<ul>
<li>
The cvctw.edict.Edict<b>Definition</b> class has a list (ArrayList) of cvctw.edict.Edict<b>Meaning</b> classes.
</li>

</ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>B. JMdict/EDICT attributes</h3>
<p>
Each Japanese <b>term</b> and each English <b>meaning</b> may have a number of <b>attributes</b> or annotations.

</p>
<h4>i. Attributes of Japanese terms</h4>
<p>
Japanese <b>terms</b> may have one or more "reading info" and one or more "kanji info" attributes.
<ul>
<li>
"Reading info" attributes are represented by the cvctw.edict.ReadingInfo class.
<br>
Example values of "reading info" attributes are 
<ul>
<li>"ik" word containing irregular kanji usage</li>
<li>"oik" old or irregular kana form</li>

</ul>

</li>
<li>
"Kanji info" attributes are represented by the cvctw.edict.KajniInfo class.
<br>
Example values of "kanji info" attributes are

<ul>
<li>"ateji" phonetic reading</li>
<li>"io" irregular okurigana usage</li>

</ul>

</li>
</ul>


</p>
<h4>ii. Attributes of English definitions</h4>
<p>
English <b>meanings</b> may have one or more of each of the following attributes:
<ul>
<li>"Part of speech" attributes are represented by the cvctw.edict.PartOfSpeech class.
<br>
Example values of "part of speech" attributes are
<ul>
<li>"adv" adverb</li>
<li>"conj" conjunction</li>
<li>"n" noun</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>"Context" (i.e., field or domain) attributes are represented by the

<br>
Example values of "context" attributes are
<ul>
<li>"biol" biology term</li>
<li>"geol" geology term</li>
<li>"music" music term</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li>"Dialect" attributes are represented by the 
cvctw.edict.Dialect class.
<br>
Example values of "dialect" attributes are
<ul>
<li>"osb" Osaka-ben</li>
<li>"kyb" Kyoto-ben</li>
<li>"std" Tokyo-ben</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>"Sense" attributes are represented by the 
cvctw.edict.Sense class.
<br>
Example values of "sense" attributes are
<ul>
<li>"joc" jocular, humorous term</li>
<li>"obs" obsolete term</li>
<li>"derog" derogatory</li>
</ul>
</li>






<li>"Language" attributes are represented by the 
cvctw.edict.Language class.
<br>
"Language" attributes appear in the JMdict/EDICT file followed by a colon (":") which optionally may be followed by a term or expression in that language, for example, <i>(spa: mezcal)</i>.
<br>
Example values of "language" attributes are
<ul>
<li>"bul" Bulgarian</li>
<li>"dan" Danish</li>
<li>"spa" Spanish</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>"Antonym" attributes are represented by the 
cvctw.edict.Antonym class.
<br>
Each Japanese "antonym" attribute has one or more associated Japanese 
terms, expressesd using one of the Japanese alphabets.
</li>

<li>"Xref" (cross-reference) attributes are represented by the 
cvctw.edict.Xref class.
<br>
Each Japanese "xref" attribute has one or more associated Japanese 
terms, expressesd using one of the Japanese alphabets.
<br>
These "xref" attributes appear in the JMdict/EDICT file as 
"See xxxx" annotations.
</li>



<li>"Wasei" attributes are represented by the 
cvctw.edict.Wasei class.
<br>
Wasei-eigo are Japanese-language expressions based on English words or parts of word combinations, that do not exist in standard English or whose meanings differ from the words from which they were derived [source Wikipedia].
<br>
Each English "wasei" attribute has one or more associated English 
terms or phrases.
</li>
</ul>



</p>
<p>
All <b>attributes</b> appear in the JMdict/EDICT file as parenthetical annotations, enclosed in parentheses "(xx)"  except for "context" <b>attributes</b>, which are enclosed in curly brackets
"{xx}".
<br>
Most <b>attributes</b> that support associated terms (the last four described above) may be followed by more than one, comma-delimited terms or phrases, for instance "(wasei: uniform, soldier)" or "(eng: coffee, dut: koffie)".
